# -Energy-Consumption-Analysis
Problem Statement:

Project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

Data Understanding

The Dataset spans from 2012 to 2021 and contains information about BPS organizations, including public hospitals and school boards.Key attributes include organization details, operational information, energy consumption data, and GHG emissions.
